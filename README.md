# paging

This program tests the hit ratio and fault ratio of FIFO, LRU, and Optimal strategy. Results are getting higher fault ratio for Optimal strategy, reason unknown but submitting as-is. The program is set to test with 50 pages, a run length of 5000 steps with randomized page requests. It is set to have 10 frames for each test. In order to change those parameters, the respective numbers can be changed in src/main.rs on lines 144, 146, 148, and 150. Results for my own run can be found in the file named result. Program can be run by installing Rust and Cargo https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html then using the command "cargo run".
